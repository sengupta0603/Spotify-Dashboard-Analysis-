# Spotify-Dashboard-Analysis-
Spotify Interactive Dashboard using PowerBI HTML Python &amp; Deneb


Project Overview
This project involves the development of a Power BI dashboard to analyze Spotify data. The dashboard provides insights into top streams, tracks, artists, and other relevant metrics. The data was collected using the Spotify API, with all cover URLs and other details fetched using Python. The analysis and visualization were enhanced using Bravo, HTML Deneb, and heatmaps.

Features
Data Collection: Automated data collection from Spotify API.
Comprehensive Analysis: Insights into top streams, tracks, and artists.
Interactive Visualizations: Use of Bravo, HTML Deneb, and heatmaps to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards.
Dynamic Content: Display of album covers fetched via Spotify API.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy to navigate and understand dashboard for users.

Data Collection
Data was collected from Spotify API using Python. The spotify_data_fetch.py script is responsible for:

Authenticating and connecting to Spotify API.
Fetching top streams, tracks, artists, and cover URLs.
Storing the fetched data into a CSV file for use in Power BI.

The Power BI dashboard is designed to provide comprehensive insights into the Spotify data. It includes:

Heatmaps: To visualize the distribution of streams.
Interactive Charts: For detailed analysis of top tracks and artists.
Album Covers: Displayed using HTML and Deneb visualizations.
Filters and Slicers: To customize the view based on user preferences.
Instructions for Using Bravo, HTML Deneb, and Heatmaps
Bravo: Used for advanced DAX editing and optimization.
HTML Deneb: Utilized for embedding HTML content, such as album covers, within Power BI.
Heatmaps: Implemented to show the intensity of streams and other metrics.

Technologies Used

Python: For data fetching and preprocessing.
Power BI: For creating the dashboard.
Spotify API: To get data about tracks, artists, and album covers.
Bravo: For optimizing DAX queries.
HTML Deneb: For embedding HTML visualizations.
Heatmaps: For visual representation of data intensity.


Conclusion : 
The analysis of Spotify data through the Power BI dashboard has provided several key insights into streaming behavior and trends on the platform. By leveraging data collected via the Spotify API, we visualized and understood the performance of top tracks, artists, and albums, as well as overall streaming patterns. The dashboard highlighted the most streamed tracks and artists, revealing popularity trends across regions and time periods, and identified peak streaming times and days, which are crucial for optimizing marketing campaigns.
The inclusion of album covers added a visual element that enhanced the user experience and provided quick visual correlations between popular tracks and their album art. These findings can help artists, record labels, and marketers tailor their strategies, optimize release schedules, and engage more effectively with their audiences. The analysis serves as a powerful tool for making informed decisions, demonstrating the value of data-driven insights in the music industry and paving the way for future predictive analytics and deeper demographic studies.
